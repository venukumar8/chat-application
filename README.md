               of the peple whom they want to chat with.we use mongodb server for backend storing of the chat and to store the user data to make easy login every time.
               make sure that backend is running in the local host server before login into the chat application.
            * to run backend:
                            *open command prompt 
                            *install all required packeges by typing npm install
                            *type "cd path of the backend"
                            *type node server.js
                            *local host will apper and shows "backend is running on the local host
                            *now run frontend 
                            *type cd path of frontend
                            *insatll -y init
                            *local host will appear
                            *open the local host link or open the webpage by pening the index file from the frontend folder use this metho when were their is a issue in opening the 
                                webpage through localhost
                               chat application web page will be opend
              we used socet.io for dynamic reloading the  webpages and chats.to interact or communicate with each other both the users should be in active state to read the message 
              otherwise message will not apper to the user when were he will bw login.we can aslo make group chats.
